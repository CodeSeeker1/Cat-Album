		<h2>These are Savannah cats, which are among my favourite breed of cats,look here at a preview of my collection.
		</h2>
		<h2>The Savannah is a hybrid cat breed. It is a cross between a serval and a domestic cat. They are the largest
			of the domestic cat breeds. A Savannah cat is a cross between a domestic cat and a serval, a medium-sized,
			large-eared wild African cat. The unusual cross became popular among breeders at the end of the 1990s, and
			in 2001 The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted it as a new registered breed. In May 2012, TICA
			accepted it as a championship breed.</h2>
